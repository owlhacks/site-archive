                                Owlhacks is a hackathon hosted by Temple University students where we invite student programmers from all over to come to Philadelphia and show of their hacking skills.  Upon arriving you can work in a group of up to four people for thirty-six hours to create a mind-blowing application, learn new technologies, or show-off by teaching others.

                                Unfortunately, if you are not a student you are not allowed to be on site during the hacking.  However, if you are a skilled programmer and would be willing to mentor students during the course of the event, please reach out to us at yurkaninryan@gmail.com.  Otherwise, feel free to see the awesome things students come up with during the demos on April 12th.

                                Top prizes are TBA, but usually involve thousands of dollars and perks from company sponsors.  Sponsors can also offer their own prizes for specific categories, which they judge and fund themselves.

                                Owlhacks is run by a group of insane, sleep-deprieved students from Temple University's TUDevs club.  All funding for Owlhacks comes from corporate sponsor donations, and some on the side panhandling in Center City.
