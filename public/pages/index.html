                                Unfortunately, if you are not a student you are not allowed to be on site during the hacking.  However, if you are a skilled programmer and would be willing to mentor students during the course of the event, please reach out to us at yurkaninryan@gmail.com.  Otherwise, feel free to see the awesome things students come up with during the demos on April 12th.

                                Top prizes are TBA, but usually involve thousands of dollars and perks from company sponsors.  Sponsors can also offer their own prizes for specific categories, which they judge and fund themselves.
